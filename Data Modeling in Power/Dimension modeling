Data modeling is a conceptual represesntation of the data 

Data modeling techniques are many : the most common , kimboll : dimensional modeling 

Dimension modeling consists of : Facts , dimensions 


Fact : matrix 
domension : context 



Schema : Start Schema 
- the star schema name comes from how the facts and dimesnions are connected 

PowerBi is faster and easier to use dimesnional modeling " Star Schema " 


Fact : consists of two type of columns , the fact , keys 
facts : the metrix , measure of your buisness process 
keys : How to establish relationships between facts and the dimension table 


Facts tell you How often - How much 


dimensions 
- give you the rest of the details 
- contains static and slowely changing data 
- in the star schema dimensions not lined to other dimensions

kimboll : dimensional model 

concepts : Facts and dimesnions 

fact : matrix of the business process 
dimension : matrix of the business model 


PowerBi is optimized to use star schema over any other schema 
powerbi is faster and eaiser approach with dimension schema 


Fact table made up of " Facts < measueres > , dimensions 

facts are the measuere of matrix from your business process 
- sales 
- employee count 
- num of website visits 
those kind of values that generally dates and numbers can aggregate in some way
Keys is how to establish a relationships between facts tables and dimensions
tables 
- in STAR SCHEMA , dimensions not cnnected to the other dimensions tables 



Datasets will frequently come in a "wide" format, containing both fact and dimensional data. 
Breaking these files out into facts and dimensions will improve queries and can improve performance on larger datasets.
