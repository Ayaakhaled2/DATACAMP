Star and snowflake schemas

1) Star schema alllow one or more facts tables surrounding by the dimension table 

2) snsow flake schema allow one or more fact taable except it allows relationships between dimensions 
. A snowflake schema is essentially an extension of star schema where each dimension can be connected to one or more dimensions as well


Starschema : 
1) eaiser to use 
2) easy for buisness users to understand 
3) most bi tools optimized for starschema 
4) sometimes we use snow flake schema in dwh because 
- starschema has some duplicates and that effect the storage and performnce 
- start schema nit ideal for frequently udated data especially with large dimensions

1) powerbi has his built on performance analyzer 
- when enabled performance analyzer it keeps track of at least threee key measures on each visuals 

- Each visual has three components 
 1) How long did the dax query take 
 2) How long did the visual take to render 
 3) How did everything else takes : waiting time on other operations including waiting for cross filtering operations to complete

1) DAX query slowness 
1) Tune dax operations 
2) Improve data loading and performance

1) use less complicated visuals 
2) show less visuals on the screen 


Note : dotted line in the relation ships mean it is not active , so you need to edit this

Snowflake schemas
While Power BI is optimized for star schemas, it needs to work in a variety of use cases. One alternative data modeling approach is to use snowflake schemas, where dimensions can be connected to other dimensions.

A big difference between the two is how they handle hierarchical data. Star dimensions tend to have all levels of a hierarchy in the same table. With snowflake dimensions, hierarchy levels are broken out into multiple tables. 



 With snowflake schemas, there will be less duplication which means updating records is more efficient. However, 
 star schemas are easier for business users to understand and most BI tools optimize performance for this schema.
