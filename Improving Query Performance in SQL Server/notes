when writing sql query there are many ways to achieve the same result 
- sql is case insensitive 

- when writing query it is good practice to stick to consistent format to make query easier  read , understand and to debug 


#Suggestions 
1) be consistent 

- use uppercase for keywords ( SELECT FROM WHERE .. ) 
- create new line for each makor processing syntax 
( SELECT ... 
  FROM .... 
  WHERE ,,,,,, ) 
  
 - indent code 
   - sunquery 
   - on statment 
   - and / or condition 
   - lines with many column names 
  
  - use ; at the end of the query 
  - use alis

   /* */ : comment block of code 
   -- : comment line of code
