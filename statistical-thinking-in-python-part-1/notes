EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ( EDA ) 
the process of organize , plotting and summarizing your data 

GRAPHICAL DATA ANALYSIS : 
take the data in tabular form and represent it graphically 
The greatest value of a picture is that it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.
It is important to understand what you can do before you learn how to measure how well you seem to have done it.
 
 Tnum of bins by default = 10 bins in histogram
 The "square root rule" is a commonly-used rule of thumb for choosing the number of bins: choose the number of bins to be the square root of the number of samples.
 
 
Histogram : 
 different data sets looks different depends on the number of bins 
2) we are not plotting all the data so we are losing the actual values 
 
to solve the dis adv of histogram : 
use be swarm plot 
y-axis : quantitative data 
 
there's a limit to the efficiency of bee swarm plot 
with a big data set : the edges will overlapp 
 
 
# Plot all ECDFs on the same plot
_ = plt.plot(x_set , y_set)
_ = plt.plot(x_vers,y_vers)
_ = plt.plot(x_virg , y_virg)
 
 
 
# Annotate the plot
plt.legend(('setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'), loc='lower right')
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
 
# Display the plot
plt.show()
